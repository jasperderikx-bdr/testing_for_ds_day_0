# The test is written correctly. Make it pass, by expanding the implementation of increment().

# -- Exercise 3 --
# Similarly, we would like to test if a TypeError is raised when increment() is called with a string. Start by
# implementing this test.
# The problem that arises is that our type checker MyPy, won't accept this code. You can see this when you try to commit
# the code. Finish by making sure that MyPy ignores this (on purpose) ill typed line of code.

# -- Exercise 4 --
# For demonstration purposes we've grouped the following two tests in a class, later we'll see why this can be handy.
# Pytest discovers tests if you: prefix the filenames with "test_", prefix classes with "Test" and prefix functions and
# methods with "test_". To see all the tests that pytest has discovered, run: ```pytest --collect-only```.
# Make sure these tests also pass.
